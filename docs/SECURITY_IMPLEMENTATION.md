# ChromSploit Framework Security Implementation

## Overview

The ChromSploit Framework has been updated with comprehensive security controls to ensure safe operation while maintaining educational value. All exploit modules now inherit from a secure base class that enforces safety policies.

## Key Security Features

### 1. SafeExploitBase Class

All exploits now inherit from `SafeExploitBase`, which provides:

- **Mandatory Safety Modes**: All exploits default to simulation mode
- **Authorization System**: Real exploitation requires explicit authorization codes
- **Safety Checks**: Comprehensive validation before any operation
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for security review
- **Target Validation**: Only localhost and private IPs allowed by default

### 2. Safety Modes

The framework supports four safety modes:

1. **SIMULATION** (Default)
   - No real exploitation occurs
   - Creates educational demonstrations
   - Generates safe proof-of-concept files
   - Perfect for learning and training

2. **EDUCATIONAL**
   - Explains vulnerabilities without execution
   - Provides detailed technical information
   - Shows mitigation strategies
   - No system interaction

3. **DEMONSTRATION**
   - Visual demonstrations of exploits
   - Safe, controlled examples
   - No harmful payloads
   - Suitable for security presentations

4. **AUTHORIZED**
   - Real exploitation (when explicitly authorized)
   - Requires valid authorization codes
   - Still includes safety boundaries
   - Full audit trail maintained

### 3. Global Security Policy

The `SecurityPolicy` class enforces framework-wide controls:

- **Emergency Stop**: Instantly blocks all operations
- **Operation Authorization**: Specific operations require authorization
- **Target Restrictions**: Whitelist/blacklist for targets
- **Security Levels**: Framework-wide security posture
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all security events

### 4. Safe Exploit Implementations

#### CVE-2024-32002 (Git RCE)
- Simulates repository creation without actual Git hooks
- Creates educational materials explaining the vulnerability
- Demonstrates symbolic link attacks safely
- No actual command execution

#### CVE-2025-24813 (Tomcat RCE)
- Generates safe demonstration WAR files
- Simulates deployment without real webshells
- Educational JSP pages explain the vulnerability
- No system compromise

#### OAuth Phishing
- Creates security awareness training materials
- Demonstrates phishing techniques safely
- No credential capture
- Focuses on education and prevention

## Usage Examples

### Running in Simulation Mode (Default)

```python
from exploits import CVE2024_32002_Exploit

# Create exploit instance - defaults to safe mode
exploit = CVE2024_32002_Exploit()

# Execute simulation
result = exploit.execute()

# Review educational content
print(result['educational_info'])
```

### Educational Mode

```python
from exploits import CVE2025_24813_Exploit, SafetyMode

# Create exploit instance
exploit = CVE2025_24813_Exploit()

# Set educational mode
exploit.set_safety_mode(SafetyMode.EDUCATIONAL)

# Get educational content
result = exploit.execute()
print(result['explanation'])
print(result['techniques'])
print(result['mitigations'])
```

### Authorized Mode (Requires Valid Auth Code)

```python
from exploits import CVE2024_32002_Exploit, SafetyMode

# Create exploit instance
exploit = CVE2024_32002_Exploit()

# Attempt to set authorized mode
auth_code = "your_authorization_code_here"
if exploit.set_safety_mode(SafetyMode.AUTHORIZED, auth_code):
    # Execute with authorization
    result = exploit.execute(target_url="http://testlab.local")
else:
    print("Authorization failed")
```

## Security Policy Configuration

### Check Current Policy

```python
from core.security_policy import get_security_policy

policy = get_security_policy()
status = policy.get_policy_status()
print(f"Current security level: {status['security_level']}")
print(f"Emergency stop active: {status['emergency_stop']}")
```

### Emergency Stop

```python
# Activate emergency stop
policy.activate_emergency_stop("Suspicious activity detected")

# All operations are now blocked

# Clear emergency stop (requires auth)
policy.clear_emergency_stop(auth_code="emergency_clear_code")
```

## Authorization System

Authorization codes are generated using SHA-256 hashes of specific strings:

- **Safety Mode Authorization**: `CHROMSPLOIT_AUTH_{CVE_ID}_2025`
- **Security Level Changes**: `CHROMSPLOIT_LEVEL_{level}_2025`
- **Operation Authorization**: `CHROMSPLOIT_OP_{operation}_2025`
- **Target Allowlisting**: `CHROMSPLOIT_TARGET_{target}_2025`
- **Emergency Clear**: `CHROMSPLOIT_EMERGENCY_CLEAR_2025`

Use the first 16 characters of the hash as the authorization code.

## Best Practices

1. **Always Start in Simulation Mode**: Test and understand exploits safely
2. **Use Educational Mode for Learning**: Get detailed technical information
3. **Review Audit Logs**: Check `/tmp/chromsploit_audit_*.jsonl` files
4. **Validate Targets**: Ensure you have permission before testing
5. **Clean Up**: Use the cleanup() method after testing

## Compliance and Ethics

- **Authorization Required**: Never run exploits without proper authorization
- **Educational Purpose**: Use for learning and authorized security testing only
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
- **No Malicious Use**: This framework is for defensive security only

## Troubleshooting

### "Operation blocked by security policy"
- Check current security level
- Ensure operation is authorized
- Verify target is allowed

### "Emergency stop activated"
- Check for `/tmp/.chromsploit_emergency_stop` file
- Review audit logs for the cause
- Use proper authorization to clear

### "Invalid authorization code"
- Verify code generation method
- Check hash calculation
- Ensure using first 16 characters

## Conclusion

The ChromSploit Framework's security implementation ensures that powerful exploitation techniques can be studied and demonstrated safely. The multi-layered security approach provides flexibility for different use cases while preventing accidental or malicious misuse.

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility. Use these tools ethically and legally!
